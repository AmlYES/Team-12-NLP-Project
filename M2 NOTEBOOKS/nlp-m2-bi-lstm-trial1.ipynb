The Institute of technology implementation (IUT from Instituto universitario de tecnologia on Spanish) began with the creation of the first IUT at Caracas, capital city of Venezuela, called IUT. Dr. Federico Rivero Palacio adopted the French \"Institut Universitaire de Technologie\"s system, using French personnel and study system based on three-year periods, with research and engineering facilities at the same level as the main national universities to obtain French equivalent degrees. This IUT is the first and only one in Venezuela having French equivalent degrees accepted, implementing this system and observing the high-level degrees some other IUT's were created in Venezuela, regardless of this the term IUT was not used appropriately resulting in some institutions with mediocre quality and no equivalent degree in France.

size\n--------------------------------------------------\nQ: What is the term that describes the way the endosymbiont can't go back to its original phenotype?\nPredicted: \nToken-Mapped True: adaptation of the endosymbiont to the host's lifestyle leads to many changes in the endosymbiont–the foremost being drastic reduction in its genome size this is due to many genes being lost during the process of metabolism and dna repair and recombination while important genes participating in the dna to rna transcription protein translation and dna rna replication are retained that is a decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter genic regions or open reading frame orf size thus species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes of genes can be accounted for an increased number of noticeable differences between them thereby leading to changes in their evolutionary rates as the endosymbiotic bacteria related with these insects are passed on to the offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission intracellular bacteria goes through many hurdles during the process resulting in the decrease in effective population sizes

there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect notes 1 from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability notes 2 the preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability sustainability quality money
